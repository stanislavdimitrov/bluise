Currently, there is work in progress for a machine learning system, based on information obtained from the agro-business. \n\nO﻿ne of our main projects is Sustainable microalgae shrimp system. We started to devise and develop this system in 2011 and during the years solved a lot of challanges. Currently we are in process of building MVP (minimal-value proposition) and consequent installation at fish farm.\n\nEnjoy. Please connect with us to discuss your ideas, and how we can work together and make our home better.
